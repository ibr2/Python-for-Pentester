# two ways of forking is identified here, and there are more
# When a process forks, it creates a copy of itself. 
# In computer science the term fork stands for at least two different aspects: 
# The cloning of a process, as roughly described above. 
# In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a legal copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it. This way starting a distinct piece of software.
